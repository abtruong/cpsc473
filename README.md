# CPSC473 - Web Front End

Web front-end applications that demonstrate the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. These projects show the basic usage of HTML elements and tags, with CSS styling for each HTML page and JavaScript for event handling/dynamic DOM programming.

## Prerequesite Packages

None

## Getting Started

To access the HTML file, just double-click the file or Right Click > Open to launch the HTML file on your Web browser. To access the code for any of the JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files, Right Click > Edit with a text editor or any code-based IDE.

## Using the Webpages

Project 1 is a simple replicated Web page that is a derivative of the New York Times' subscription page. Most elements are implemented in the HTML file with the exception of the accordian dropdown menu near the end. All links provided in the Web page are direct links to other directories of the New York Time's Web page.

Project 2 provides a much simpler HTML page, but with dynamic JavaScript elements handling how the Web page works. All user data implemented is hard-coded and cannot be updated. If attempting to search for a user, please look up the following last names (case-insensitive):
* Truong
* Tran
* Nguyen
* Ortiz
* Sanchez

If the search is not any of these specified last names, it will display a small message on the HTML page notifying the user there were no matches to the user's specified name.
